Between 1680 and 1687, the sculptor Pierre Granier significantly intervened, replacing the missing lower legs, feet, nose, the entire right arm, and the divine attribute, the foudre, in marble. This history of intervention, visible in the restored sections and the original marble's erosion, makes the piece a crucial document for both Imperial religious culture and the 17th-century European practice of restoring and adapting antiquities for palatial display.",
        "complex-simple": "Its current state includes significant modern restorations (1680-1687) by Pierre Granier, notably the entire right arm and the foudre (lightning bolt), adapting the antique work for display in the Royal French gardens.",
        "simple-complex": "A critical aspect of this piece is its restoration history. When acquired for the French Royal Collection in 1680, the statue was incomplete. The French sculptor Pierre Granier restored it between 1680 and 1687, adding the right arm, the foudre (lightning bolt), the feet, and the plinth—all modern additions for its display in the gardens of Versailles.",
