This Apulian terracotta hydria (ca. 340–330 BCE) typifies Late Classical South Italian vase-painting. Many such vessels show the abduction of Persephone by Hades or related mythic scenes, linking water-carrying utility with funerary and fertility symbolism in the Mediterranean world. Today, examples like this are held by The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
