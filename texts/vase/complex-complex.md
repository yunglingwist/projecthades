This terracotta hydria (Apulia, ca. 340–330 BCE) exemplifies Late Classical South Italian ceramic practice, in which the hydria’s tripartite handle system and robust shoulder afford painters a broad narrative field. Programs centering on Persephone’s seizure by Hades often situate the scene within a vegetal and chthonic register, aligning the vessel’s aqueous function with themes of fertility, seasonal return, and mortuary passage. The iconography, whether attributed to prominent workshops or groups (e.g., the circle of B.M. F 308), reveals a sophisticated interplay between utilitarian form and mythic storytelling.
