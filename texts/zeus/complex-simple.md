This monumental marble statue (h. 270 cm) is a Roman Imperial depiction of Jupiter, sourced from Smyrna (ca. 2nd cent. AD). It functions as a replica of a purported Hellenistic original (2nd cent. BC?). The figure is rendered with a heavy beard, long hair, and a himation, partially draped.

Its current state includes significant modern restorations (1680â€“1687) by Pierre Granier, notably the entire right arm and the foudre (lightning bolt), adapting the antique work for display in the Royal French gardens.
