The Louvreâ€™s colossal marble Jupiter (MR 255) is an impressive example of Roman Imperial classicizing sculpture, originating from Smyrna (Izmir) and dating approximately to the 2nd century AD. Iconographically, it derives from an influential Hellenistic prototype, speculated to be from the 2nd century BC. The figure, characterized by thick, drill-worked beard and hair, a roll-crown, and a half-draped himation, reflects a canonical representation of the supreme Olympian deity.

Its acquisition into the French Royal Collection in 1680 led to extensive early modern restoration. Between 1680 and 1687, the sculptor Pierre Granier significantly intervened, replacing the missing lower legs, feet, nose, the entire right arm, and the divine attribute, the foudre, in marble. This history of intervention, visible in the restored sections and the original marble's erosion, makes the piece a crucial document for both Imperial religious culture and the 17th-century European practice of restoring and adapting antiquities for palatial display.
