The Louvre’s colossal marble statue of Jupiter (270 cm tall) is a Roman Imperial copy, created in Smyrna (İzmir) around the 2nd century AD, likely based on a Hellenistic Greek original from the 2nd century BC. Jupiter is depicted with long, wavy hair and a beard, wearing a roll-shaped crown and a cloak (himation) draped over his lower body.

A critical aspect of this piece is its restoration history. When acquired for the French Royal Collection in 1680, the statue was incomplete. The French sculptor Pierre Granier restored it between 1680 and 1687, adding the right arm, the foudre (lightning bolt), the feet, and the plinth—all modern additions for its display in the gardens of Versailles.
