The Minotaur fragment (h. 0.73 m, National Archaeological Museum) is a vital Roman iteration, likely dating to the Imperial era, of the renowned Myronian group depicting the mythological combat between Theseus and the Minotaur. The original Early Classical bronze (c. 5th century BCE) was positioned on the Athenian Acropolis. The preserved elements—torso and head—show signs of extensive post-excavation restoration, including reassembly and plaster infills for lacunae (right arm, left hand).

Its subsequent Roman history is illuminated by a deep perforation through the mouth, which formally designates the sculpture's function as a waterspout (brunnenfigur). This recontextualization from a monumental votum on the Acropolis to a decorative element in a fountain underscores the Roman practice of transforming Greek athletic and mythological agōn (contest) narratives into decorative, utilitarian, and architecturally integrated features.
