This Roman marble statue of the Minotaur (0.73 m high) is a copy of a famous Greek sculpture group made by Myron during the Early Classical period. It was discovered in Plaka, Athens, and is currently housed in the National Archaeological Museum.

The statue is unique because a hole pierced in its mouth suggests it was used as a waterspout in a fountain, showing how Romans reused classical themes.
