This statue, exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, is a Roman marble copy of a celebrated Greek bronze group depicting Theseus and the Minotaur. The original group was sculpted by Myron in the Early Classical period (c. 5th century BCE) and stood on the Athenian Acropolis. The preserved section, measuring 0.73 m, shows the Minotaur's torso and head.

The fragment has a complex history: it was found near a church in Plaka and bears signs of extensive restoration, with missing pieces (like the right arm) reassembled and filled with plaster. Most interestingly, a deep hole runs through the Minotaur's mouth, strongly suggesting this specific Roman copy was repurposed as a waterspout within a public or private fountain setting.
