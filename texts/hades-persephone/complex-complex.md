The Metropolitan Museum's Apulian red-figure hydria (Object Number 07.128.1), attributed to the Group of B.M. F 308, exemplifies Late Classical South Italian ceramic production (ca. 340–330 BCE). The extensive central panel is dedicated to the Rape of Persephone (Harpagē), a mythological event frequently situated geographically in Sicily. Compositionally, Hades’ quadriga establishes the dynamic nucleus of the narrative.

The surrounding divine retinue—including Zeus (whose authority legitimizes the act), Aphrodite and Eros (agents of desire), and Demeter and Hecate (figures of maternal loss and transition)—serves to contextualize the abduction as a foundational cosmic transition. The deliberate selection of the hydria (water jar) form and the detailed rendering of vegetal motifs amplify the thematic concern with fertility, seasonal cyclicity, and the chthonic cycle of death and renewal, directly supporting the vase's attested function as a specialized funerary offering.
