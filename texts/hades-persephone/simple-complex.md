This large terracotta hydria (water jar), attributed to the Group of B.M. F 308, originates from Apulia, Southern Italy, and dates to the Late Classical period (ca. 340â€“330 BCE). The primary scene depicted is the myth of the Abduction of Persephone by Hades, which mythological tradition often placed in Sicily. Hades' chariot dominates the center of the vase.

Surrounding the dramatic event are various deities, each connected to the myth's themes: Zeus, whose sanction was required; Aphrodite and Eros, who abetted Hades' desire; Demeter, the distressed mother; torch-bearing Hecate; and Athena. The choice of a water jar and the prominent vegetation emphasize the fertility and cyclical renewal aspects of the story, making it a common subject for funerary vases meant for tombs.
