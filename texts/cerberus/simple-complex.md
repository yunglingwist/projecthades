It depicts the three-headed guardian of Hades, a motif rooted in Eastern iconography spread via Greek and Etruscan cultures.

A key feature is the beast's paw resting on a "caput sectum" (severed head), a motif popular in regions with Celtic traditions like Liguria, blending local rituals with Roman funerary practices. The unique detail of its tail rendered as a bearded snake directly references Etruscan underworld symbolism, showcasing a rich syncretism of ancient beliefs.
