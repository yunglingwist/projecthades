The Cerberus sculpture (Inv. 1936), executed in white marble and measuring 98 cm in height, represents a sophisticated example of iconographic syncretism within the Roman Imperial artistic corpus (ca. 1st cent. BCâ€“1st cent. AD). Its typological origin derives from Oriental prototypes disseminated through Greek and Etruscan intermediaries from the 7th century BC. This particular variant, often deployed as a funerary monument within tumuli or as an acroterion, is distinguished by the chthonic guardian's interaction with a caput sectum.

This motif, especially prevalent in Celtic-influenced regions such as Iberia, Provence, and Northern Italy (including Liguria), attests to the integration of indigenous mortuary practices with Graeco-Roman mythological narratives. Furthermore, the caudal appendage rendered as an ophidian form, complete with cephalic and bearded features, directly references Etruscan eschatological iconography. While the conventional dating places it within the early Imperial period, certain scholarly interpretations suggest a later provenance, aligning with a 3rd to 6th-century AD necropolis context, reflecting ongoing debates regarding its precise chronological placement.
