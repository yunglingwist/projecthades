The bronze statue of Ares housed in the Gaziantep Museum of Archaeology represents a crucial Greek original example of Late Classical sculpture, diverging from the more common Roman copies. The god of war is presented as an ephebic nude male, exhibiting a severe expression consistent with the psychological intensity often sought in the 4th century BCE. His attributes are dualistic: the elevated helmet and spear firmly establish his martial function, yet the presence of a coiled serpent in the secondary hand is a significant detail.

This ophidian motif often denotes chthonic connections or heroic status, complicating a purely Olympian interpretation and suggesting a potential link to localized cult practices where Ares's underworld aspects were emphasized. Its status as an original bronze provides valuable insight into the metalworking techniques and iconographic complexities of the Late Classical artistic canon.
