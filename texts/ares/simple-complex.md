The statue of Ares, the Olympian God of War, is a significant Greek original bronze dating to the Late Classical period. Currently located in the Gaziantep Museum of Archaeology, the piece depicts the god as a muscular, nude youth with a severe expression. His attributes signify both warfare and chthonic power: he holds a spear in one hand and a coiled snake in the other.

The serpent is often associated with the earth and underworld. He also wears a prominent, raised helmet. The severe expression and dynamic yet balanced pose reflect the aesthetic transition typical of the Late Classical style, emphasizing psychological depth alongside physical form.
