The chariot (object no. 03.23.1) dates to the Archaic period (c. 550â€“525 BCE) and is constructed of hammered bronze plates with ivory inlays. It was recovered from a funerary tumulus at Monteleone di Spoleto and bears decorative reliefs depicting scenes of heroic combat, likely influenced by Homeric narratives.
