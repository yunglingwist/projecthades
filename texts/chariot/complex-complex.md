This object, the so-called “Bronze chariot inlaid with ivory” (c. 2nd quarter 6th century BCE, Etruscan, object number 03.23.1) represents one of the most elaborate surviving specimens of Archaic bronze-ivory (chryselephantine-inspired) chariot construction. Its hammered bronze plates, mounted on a wooden core (now lost), are complemented by ivory inlays and relief scenes that seem to narrate a hero’s martial exploits—perhaps emblematic of a Pan-Italic heroic ethos influenced by the Homeric Achilles cycle.

The chariot was interred in a tumulus burial at Monteleone di Spoleto, accompanied by other grave-goods, signifying its role in mortuary ritual, social display, and the visual articulation of elite status and mythic identity.
